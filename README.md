### How to use - This is only for me

- Run pipenv in the opic folder
- Make a script file like a data in data folder
- run TTS.py
  ```
  python TTS.py Color&Chapter (e.g. python TTS.py Blue1)
  ```
- you can get files in .../mp3 folder
- Move the files to "...mp3/Color/Chapter/" (e.g. ...mp3/Blue/1/)
- run Join.py
  ```
  python Join.py Color Chapter The_number_of_files Repetation_count (e.g. python Join.py Blue 1 21 3)
  ```
- output file will be in .../mp3/Color/Chapter/ folder and named "Color+Chapter.mp3" (e.g. Blue1.mp3)
